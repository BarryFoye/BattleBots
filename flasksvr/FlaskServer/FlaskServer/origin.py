origin = ["When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature."
,"When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature."
,"There is, also, I think, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food."
,"It seems pretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation; and that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues to vary for many generations."
,"No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation."
,"Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification."
,"As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the conditions of life appear to act in two ways, — directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the reproductive system."
,"With respect to the direct action, we must bear in mind that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lately insisted, and as I have incidentally shown in my work on \"Variation under Domestication,\" there are two factors: namely, the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions."
,"The former seems to be much the more important; for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under, as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on the other hand, dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform."
,"The effects on the offspring are either definite or in definite."
,"They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner."
,"It is extremely difficult to come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which have been thus definitely induced."
,"There can, however, be little doubt about many slight changes,— such as size from the amount of food, colour from the nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from climate, &c."
,"Each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage of our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and if the same cause were to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many individuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner."
,"Such facts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably follow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a gall-producing insect, shows us what singular modifications might result in the case of plants from a chemical change in the nature of the sap."
,"Indefinite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races."
,"We see in definite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor."
,"Even strongly-marked differences occasionally appear in the young of the same litter, and in seedlings from the same seed-capsule."
,"At long intervals of time, out of millions of individuals reared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations of structure so strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise; but monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter variations."
,"All such changes of structure, whether extremely slight or strongly marked, which appear among many individuals living together, may be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life on each individual organism, in nearly the same manner as the chill effects different men in an in definite manner, according to their state of body or constitution, causing coughs or colds, rheumatism, or inflammation of various organs."
,"With respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed conditions, namely, through the reproductive system of being affected, we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of this system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions, and partly from the similarity, as Kölreuter and others have remarked, between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions."
,"Many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions."
,"Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even when the male and female unite."
,"How many animals there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in their native country! This is generally, but erroneously attributed to vitiated instincts."
,"Many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered that a very trifling change, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds."
,"I cannot here give the details which I have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly ever lay fertile eggs."
,"Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids."
,"When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, breeding freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents."
,"I may add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions (for instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches) showing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly — perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature."
,"Some naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with the act of sexual reproduction; but this is certainly an error; for I have given in another work a long list of \"sporting plants,\" as they are called by gardeners;— that is, of plants which have suddenly produced a single bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that of the other buds on the same plant."
,"These bud variations, as they may be named, can be propagated by grafts, offsets, and sometimes by seed."
,"They occur rarely under nature, but are far from rare under culture."
,"As a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year on the same tree under uniform conditions, has been known suddenly to assume a new character; and as buds on distinct trees, growing under different conditions, have sometimes yielded nearly the same variety — for instance, buds on peach-trees producing nectarines, and buds on common roses producing moss-roses — we clearly see that the nature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in comparison with the nature of the organism in determining each particular form of variation;— perhaps of not more importance than the nature of the spark, by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited, has in determining the nature of the flames."
,"Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced, either from one or from several allied species."
,"Some effect may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external conditions of life, and some to habit; but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences between a dray and race-horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon."
,"One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or fancy."
,"Some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller's teasel, with its hooks, which can not be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling."
,"So it has probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep."
,"But when we compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man in different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with \"everlasting layers\" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further than to mere variability."
,"We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this has not been their history."
,"The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him."
,"In this sense he may be said to have made for himself useful breeds."
,"The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical."
,"It is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a single lifetime, modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle and sheep."
,"In order fully to realise what they have done it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect the animals."
,"Breeders habitually speak of an animal's organisation as something plastic, which they can model almost as they please."
,"If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities."
,"Youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other individual, and who was himself a very good judge of animals, speaks of the principle of selection as \"that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether."
,"It is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases.\" Lord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says:— \"It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it existence.\" In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding."
,"What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have been exported to almost every quarter of the world."
,"The improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes among closely allied sub-breeds."
,"And when a cross has been made, the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases."
,"If selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye — differences which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate."
,"Not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder."
,"If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail."
,"Few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon-fancier."
,"The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are here often more abrupt."
,"No one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock."
,"We have proofs that this is not so in several cases in which exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily-increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted."
,"We see an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago."
,"When a race of plants is once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the \"rogues,\" as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard."
,"With animals this kind of selection is, in fact, likewise followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to breed from his worst animals."
,"In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selection — namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties."
,"See how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight differences."
,"It is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever,— I speak after careful observation,— perhaps never, the case."
,"The law of correlated variation, the importance of which should never be overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, it cannot be doubted that the continued selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters."
,"It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have been published on the subject; and the result has been, in a corresponding degree, rapid and important."
,"But it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery."
,"I could give several references to works of high antiquity, in which the full importance of the principle is acknowledged."
,"In rude and barbarous periods of English history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered, and this may be compared to the \"roguing\" of plants by nurserymen."
,"The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese encyclopaedia."
,"Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman classical writers."
,"From passages in Genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to."
,"Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny."
,"The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs."
,"Livingstone states that good domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in the interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans."
,"Some of these facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages."
,"It would, indeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious."
,"At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to anything of the kind in the country."
,"But, for our purpose, a form of selection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important."
,"Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed."
,"Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as Bakewell, Collins, &c., by this very same process, only carried on more methodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes, the forms and qualities of their cattle."
,"Slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question have been made long ago, which may serve for comparison."
,"In some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed, individuals of the same breed exist in less civilised districts, where the breed has been less improved."
,"There is reason to believe that King Charles' spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch."
,"Some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it."
,"It is known that the English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses with the foxhound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually that, though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain like our pointer."
,"By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent Arabs, so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are favoured in the weights which they carry."
,"Lord Spencer and others have shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country."
,"By comparing the accounts given in various old treatises of the former and present state of carrier and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India, and Persia, we can trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon."
,"Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of selection which may be considered as unconscious, in so far that the breeders could never have expected, or even wished, to produce the result which ensued — namely, the production of the distinct strains."
,"The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, \"have been purely bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years."
,"There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr. Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties.\""
,"If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on."
,"We see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs."
,"In plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks."
,"No one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant."
,"No one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock."
,"The pear, though cultivated in classical times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a fruit of very inferior quality."
,"I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously."
,"It has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly better variety chanced to appear, selecting it, and so onwards."
,"But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pears which they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find."
,"A large amount of change, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens."
,"If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture."
,"It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that acquired by the plants in countries anciently civilised."
,"In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at least during certain seasons."
,"And in two countries very differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of \"natural selection,\" as will hereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed."
,"This, perhaps, partly explains why the varieties kept by savages, as has been remarked by some authors, have more of the character of true species than the varieties kept in civilised countries."
,"On the view here given of the important part which selection by man has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants or fancies."
,"We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external characters, and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs."
,"Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal."
,"He can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature."
,"No man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention."
,"But to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect."
,"The man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical, selection."
,"Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted."
,"Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus, — a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed."
,"Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight, in one's own possession."
,"Nor must the value which would formerly have been set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of by the value which is now set on them, after several breeds have fairly been established."
,"It is known that with pigeons many slight variations now occasionally appear, but these are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection in each breed."
,"The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Toulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows."
,"These views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed, namely, that we know hardly anything about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds."
,"But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly be said to have a distinct origin."
,"A man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals, and thus improves them, and the improved animals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood."
,"But they will as yet hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their history will have been disregarded."
,"When further improved by the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will be recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial name."
,"In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the spreading of a new sub-breed will be a slow process."
,"As soon as the points of value are once acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious selection will always tend,— perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion,— perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants,— slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be."
,"But the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes."
,"I will now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable or the reverse, to man's power of selection."
,"A high degree of variability is obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient, with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction."
,"But as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept."
,"Hence, number is of the highest importance for success."
,"On this principle Marshall formerly remarked, with respect to the sheep of part of Yorkshire, \"as they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly in small lots, they never can be improved.\" On the other hand, nurserymen, from keeping large stocks of the same plant, are generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new and valuable varieties."
,"A large number of individuals of an animal or plant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation are favourable."
,"When the individuals are scanty all will be allowed to breed, whatever their quality may be, and this will effectually prevent selection."
,"But probably the most important element is that the animal or plant should be so highly valued by man, that the closest attention is paid to even the slightest deviations in its qualities or structure."
,"Unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected."
,"I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend to this plant."
,"No doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected."
,"As soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species) those many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have appeared during the last half-century."
,"With animals, facility in preventing crosses is an important element in the formation of new races,— at least, in a country which is already stocked with other races."
,"In this respect enclosure of the land plays a part."
,"Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species."
,"Pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may be improved and kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this circumstance must have largely favoured the formation of new breeds."
,"Pigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed they serve for food."
,"On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, can not be easily matched, and, although so much valued by women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country."
,"Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, &c., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; for recently in certain parts of Spain and of the United States this animal has been surprisingly modified and improved by careful selection; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is exposed when domesticated, seems to have a singularly inflexible organisation, though it has varied to a slight extent, as I have elsewhere described."
,"Some authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our domestic productions is soon reached, and can never afterward be exceeded."
,"It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been attained in any one case; for almost all our animals and plants have been greatly improved in many ways within a recent period; and this implies variation."
,"It would be equally rash to assert that characters now increased to their utmost limit, could not, after remaining fixed for many centuries, again vary under new conditions of life."
,"No doubt, as Mr. Wallace has remarked with much truth, a limit will be at last reached."
,"For instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any terrestrial animal, as this will be determined by the friction to be overcome, the weight of the body to be carried, and the power of contraction in the muscular fibres."
,"But what concerns us is that the domestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almost every character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do the distinct species of the same genera."
,"Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire has proved this in regard to size, and so it is with colour, and probably with the length of hair."
,"With respect to fleetness, which depends on many bodily characters, Eclipse was far fleeter, and a dray-horse is comparably stronger, than any two natural species belonging to the same genus."
,"So with plants, the seeds of the different varieties of the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the seeds of the distinct species in any one genus in the same two families."
,"The same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several varieties of the plum, and still more strongly with the melon, as well as in many other analogous cases."
,"To sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants."
,"Changed conditions of life are of the highest importance in causing variability, both by acting directly on the organisation, and indirectly by affecting the reproductive system."
,"It is not probable that variability is an inherent and necessary contingent, under all circumstances."
,"The greater or less force of inheritance and reversion determine whether variations shall endure."
,"Variability is governed by many unknown laws, of which correlated growth is probably the most important."
,"Something, but how much we do not know, may be attributed to the definite action of the conditions of life."
,"Some, perhaps a great, effect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts."
,"The final result is thus rendered infinitely complex."
,"In some cases the intercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played an important part in the origin of our breeds."
,"When several breeds have once been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed."
,"With plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings, buds, etc., the importance of crossing is immense; for the cultivator may here disregard the extreme variability both of hybrids and of mongrels, and the sterility of hybrids; but plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary."
,"Over all these causes of change, the accumulative action of selection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or unconsciously and slowly, but more efficiently, seems to have been the predominant power."]
