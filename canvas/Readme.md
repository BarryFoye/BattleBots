# BattleBots Game Server

This is the processing based battle bots game server. The server is responsible for hosting the game physics and supports visualising the game. Bots can interact with the game server using REST API calls.

## Developing

To develop the game, it is recommended to get the following tools setup and running on your local machine:
 - Python 3.x (ensure python is on your system path)
 - Processing with the following add-ons:
    - Mode: Python by Jonathan Feinberg
    - Library: HTTP Requests for Processing

To start the server open `canvas.pyde` with Processing and click the run button.
